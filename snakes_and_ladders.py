Problem:

    Whilst playing a game of snakes and ladders, Sam lands on
    square 11. On square 14, there is a ladder to square 29. On
    square 17, there is a snake to square 4.

    The function 'move' takes an input, representing the next dice
    roll, and should output the square that Sam ends up at next.

Tests:

    >>> move(1)
    12
    >>> move(2)
    13
    >>> move(3)
    29
    >>> move(4)
    15
    >>> move(5)
    16
    >>> move(6)
    4
